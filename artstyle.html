        </p>The Italian Renaissance, a period in the Italian history that covered the 15th and 16th centuries, developed a culture that spread across Europe and marked the transition from the Middle Ages to modernity. The ancient ancient period of Italy (about 10,000 to 13,000 A.D.), during which two centuries of monastic life formed, established a culture that gave birth to the Renaissance, which in turn became the first European modern society in the Middle Ages. For these four centuries, there were numerous religious rituals associated with religious practices and cultural practices.   </div>

    <h3>High Renaissance</h3>

      <div><em>Example of High Renaissance: The Last Supper by Leonardo da Vinci</em>
      <p>
        
        </p>In art history, the High Renaissance is a short period of the most exceptional artistic production in the Italian states, particularly Rome, capital of the Papal States, and in Florence, during the Italian Renaissance. During the 17 th century the Renaissance flourished even better, and its significance is undeniable.The ancient Roman and Italian history has also changed in the past. The early medieval Spanish Renaissance has largely been dominated by the English Church, even though no religious affiliation emerged of the English Church in time. In the 17th century the French religious world was dominated by the Dutch Catholic Church, and the Dutch Church did not influence the Roman Church.
